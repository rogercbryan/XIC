# The Crowdsale
Just so this is not left for the code to explain itself, the crowdsale will be executed as follows:

This will be a block-based coin issue.  Each block has it's own exchange rate of ETH to XIC and the price per XIC goes up in each new block.  For a block to be completed, all coins allocated to that block must be distributed to participants.  There is a minimum contribution of 1 ETH for this crowdsale and this is the only digital currency we will be accepting at this time.  This is a capped crowdsale and our cap is 200 million XIC. We are planning to include dividends into the system but have not fully developed the rules for such a component yet.  

We have the ability to self destruct the crowdsale contract at any time if we feel we are being attacked or if something goes terribly wrong with the code.  Our mint functions and contracts utilize password protection for sensitive functions to help avoid attacks.  We also have the ability to also change these passwords at any given time if we feel there might be a threat to our system.  Our goal is to protect our investors and their ability to participate in our project.

If there are any problems or questions, please refer to our subreddit and post your question or concern.  It will be addressed by someone on our team.

# The Risks (PLEASE READ THIS)

Digital Currencies are very risky assets.  Please be careful and pay attention to the status of our crowdsale before attempting to contribute.  Any attempt to send ETH to a closed crowdsale could result in either the loss of gas needed for the transaction or all of the ETH sent to the contract, including the gas.  We will do our best to maintain constant communication with our current and potential contributors about the status of the project and the contracts involved.  We do not assume any liability for any ETH lost after the crowdsale has been closed.
